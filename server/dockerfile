# 1. Use an Official Node Runtime as a parent image
# We use 'alpine' because it is tiny (saves ~800MB vs standard node image)
FROM node:18-alpine

# 2. Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. Copy package.json and package-lock.json FIRST
# This allows Docker to use "Layer Caching"
# If package.json hasn't changed, Docker skips 'npm install' (Fast builds!)
COPY package*.json ./

# 4. Install dependencies
# --production flag skips devDependencies (like jest/supertest) to save space
RUN npm install --production

# 5. Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# 6. Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# 7. Define the command to run the app
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
